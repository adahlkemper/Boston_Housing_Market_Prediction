# Boston_Housing_Market_Prediction

## Motivations
The development of an algortithm assessing the validity of a for model for predicting housing prices in Boston arises from a fundamental need to critically evaluate and enhance predictive accuracy in the field of real estate economics. The utilization of linear regression as a tool is driven by several key motivations within the realm of empirical research and data analysis. Firstly, linear regression provides a well-established and interpretable framework for modeling relationships between predictor variables and the target variable, facilitating a transparent evaluation of the underlying assumptions and parameter estimates. Secondly, it serves as a benchmark against which more complex models can be compared, aiding in the identification of any shortcomings or areas for improvement in the predictive model. Moreover, linear regression offers valuable insights into the linear components of the data, enabling a foundational understanding of the factors influencing housing prices in Boston. Ultimately, this approach contributes to the rigorous evaluation and refinement of predictive models, enhancing their practical utility in real-world applications. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques we aspire to uncover hidden patterns and improve predictive performance, ultimately contributing to more reliable and informed decision-making processes in the realm of property valuation and investment.

## Build Status
The algorithm focuses solely on the Boston housing market. In order to see if the linear regression method is robust future researchers can test the code against data from other markets.
